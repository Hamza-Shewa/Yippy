# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Yippy is a macOS menu-bar clipboard manager (Swift 5, AppKit, RxSwift, CocoaPods + Swift Package Manager; project deployment target 10.13/10.14). It only builds and runs on macOS with Xcode. There is no linter or formatter configured.

## Build, run, test

Always open/build `Yippy.xcworkspace` (not the `.xcodeproj`). Dependencies come from two places:
- CocoaPods: `Default`, `LoginServiceKit` (from a git URL), `RxSwift`/`RxCocoa`, plus `RxBlocking`/`RxTest` for tests.
- Swift Package Manager: `HotKey` (the `mattDavo/HotKey` fork) and `Sparkle`, pinned in `Yippy.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`.

`Pods/` is committed, so `pod install` is only needed when the `Podfile` changes. It also carries local patches (e.g. `Pods/LoginServiceKit` was edited to compile on Xcode 27), which a `pod install` would overwrite.

There are three shared schemes, each with its own build configuration and bundle id:

| Scheme | Config | Bundle id | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Yippy` | Debug/Release | `MatthewDavidson.Yippy` | production run/archive |
| `Yippy Beta` | Beta Debug/Beta Release (`BETA` flag, different status-bar icon) | `MatthewDavidson.YippyBeta` | day-to-day development, beta archive |
| `Yippy XCTest` | `XCTest` (`DEBUG XCTEST` flags) | `MatthewDavidson.YippyXCTest` | the only scheme that runs tests |

```sh
xcodebuild -workspace Yippy.xcworkspace -scheme "Yippy Beta" build

# all unit tests / one class / one test
xcodebuild test -workspace Yippy.xcworkspace -scheme "Yippy XCTest" -only-testing:YippyTests
xcodebuild test -workspace Yippy.xcworkspace -scheme "Yippy XCTest" -only-testing:YippyTests/HistoryCacheTests
xcodebuild test -workspace Yippy.xcworkspace -scheme "Yippy XCTest" -only-testing:YippyTests/HistoryCacheTests/testDataWhenFMReturnsNil
```

Xcode 27 rejects the project's 10.13/10.14 deployment target, and signing fails without the project team's certificate. The project settings are deliberately unchanged, so on a machine like that pass overrides on the command line:
`-destination 'platform=macOS' MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=`.

`YippyUITests` drives the real app via XCUITest and needs the test runner to have Accessibility permission. The scheme's launch environment sets `SRCROOT`, and the UI tests forward it to the app (see "UI-test hooks" below). `create-installer.sh` builds the `.dmg` installer; its usage is in the README.

Because the app-support directory and `UserDefaults` are keyed by bundle id, Yippy, Yippy Beta and the XCTest build each have separate history, favourites and settings.

## Architecture

### Singletons and wiring
`AppDelegate` creates `Controller.main = Controller(state: State.main, settings: Settings.main)`. `Controller` owns the status item/menu (including the `Updater`'s menu item) and the window controllers (history panel, preview, and lazily the welcome/help/about/settings windows). Code reaches `State.main`, `Settings.main` and `Controller.main` globally instead of through injection; only the history/model layer takes injected dependencies (which is what the unit tests mock).

`State` is the hub: RxSwift `BehaviorRelay`s for UI state (`isHistoryPanelShown`, `panelPosition`, `currentScreen`, `previewHistoryItem`, `showsRichText`, `pastesRichText`, `ignoredAppBundleIds`) plus two `History` objects (the clipboard `history` and `favourites`, each with its own `HistoryCache`) and the `PasteboardMonitor`. Windows and menu items subscribe to these relays, so e.g. toggling the panel is just `isHistoryPanelShown.accept(...)`. `State.bind` mirrors relay values back into `Settings.main` (a `Codable` struct persisted to `UserDefaults` through the `Default` pod), which is how settings persist: there are no explicit "save settings" calls for those fields. `Settings.main` reads and writes `UserDefaults` on every access. `Settings` has a hand-written `init(from:)`; a new field must be read with `decodeIfPresent` and a default, otherwise settings saved by older versions fail to decode and everything resets.

### Clipboard capture → history → disk
1. `PasteboardMonitor` polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount` every 50 ms, tracks the frontmost app, and calls `History.pasteboardDidChange(_:originBundleId:)`.
2. `History` skips the change if `originBundleId` is in `ignoredBundleIds` (the Ignored Apps setting; the change count is still recorded). The origin is the frontmost app, so a background process writing to the clipboard is attributed to whatever is in front. It drops items carrying denylisted types (password managers, `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, etc.) and ignores Yippy's own `historyItemId` type. A copy whose types and bytes exactly match an existing item moves that item to the top instead of adding a duplicate (`indexOfItem(withData:)`, using a lazily filled per-item fingerprint so it doesn't re-read everything); anything else becomes a `HistoryItem(unsavedData:)` inserted at index 0 with all its types.
3. `History` mutates its in-memory array synchronously, notifies subscribers (a closure list via `History.subscribe` with a `History.Change` enum, not Rx), then calls `HistoryFileManager`, which does all disk work on one serial background queue.
4. On disk: `~/Library/Application Support/<bundle id>/history/<item UUID>/<pasteboard type raw value>` (one file per type) plus `history/order.xml`, an array of UUID strings that defines item order. Favourites use the same layout under `favourites/`: `HistoryFileManager` takes the folder as a parameter and has two shared instances, `.default` and `.favourites`. `loadHistory` reconciles the folders against the order file and alerts on mismatches. Errors/warnings also go to `error.log`/`warning.log` in the same directory via `ErrorLogger`/`WarningLogger`.
5. `HistoryItem` loads data lazily through `HistoryCache` (LRU, 100 MB). Items must be registered with the cache before `data(withId:forType:)` serves them from it; `unsavedData` holds the bytes until the file is written, then `startCaching()` drops them.

### Favourites
Favourites are a second `History` (`State.main.favourites`, no size limit). Each favourite holds its own copy of the data (`History.toggleFavourite`, in `History+Favourites.swift`), so clearing or trimming the clipboard history never removes one. In the panel, `YippyViewController` switches between the two lists through `ItemGroup` (the buttons above the table), and every `Results` value carries the `History` it came from. Every row has a heart button (`YippyItemBaseCellView.favouriteButton`, filled when `History.containsItem(withSameContentAs:)` finds the content in the favourites; that check caches a hash per item id because it runs for every drawn row) and ⌃F does the same for the selected row. The row's right-click menu offers the same toggle.

### Pasting
`YippyHistory` wraps whichever list the table is showing. `items` can be a filtered search result, so a table row is not a history index: every action goes through `historyIndex(ofRow:)`, which looks the item up by `fsId` in the full history. Don't pass a row straight to `History.deleteItem/moveItem`.

`paste(selected:plainText:)` with `plainText: true` (⇧Return, or the right-click menu's "Paste as Plain Text") writes only `HistoryItem.getUnstyledText()` (the `.string` data, else the text of the RTF) and pastes the whole item if it has no text. `paste` moves the item to the top (clipboard only; favourites keep their order), clears the pasteboard and immediately calls `history.recordPasteboardChange(withCount:)` so `History` ignores the change Yippy itself made. It then writes the item (`HistoryItem` is an `NSPasteboardWriting` using `.promised`, so data is only read when requested) and polls until Yippy is no longer the active app before synthesizing ⌘V with `Helper.pressCommandV()`. That needs the Accessibility permission, which is why the Welcome window exists. `YippyWindowController` restores the previously frontmost app when the panel closes.

### Panel UI and key handling
`Main.storyboard` instantiates `YippyWindowController` (an `NSPanel` subclass, `YippyWindow`). Its frame is driven by `combineLatest(panelPosition, currentScreen)` through `PanelPosition.getFrame`; `State` polls the mouse every 0.1 s to update `currentScreen`. `YippyViewController` combines `results` and `selected` relays and renders them in `YippyTableView` in `onAllChange`. The Ignored Apps settings tab (`IgnoredAppsSettingsViewController`) is built in code and added in `SettingsTabViewController`, not in the storyboard.

Keyboard handling has two separate systems:
- `YippyHotKey` wraps the `HotKey` package (system-wide hotkeys, with long-press repeat). The global toggle (default ⌘⇧V, stored in `Settings.toggleHotKey`) and the in-panel keys are all registered system-wide. The in-panel ones are listed in `YippyHotKeys.inPanel` and `YippyViewController` pauses all of them while the panel is hidden. A new in-panel shortcut must be added to that list, or it takes the key away from every other app.
- `KeyPressMonitor` (`NSEvent` monitors) is used only by `HotKeySettingsViewController` to record a new toggle shortcut.

### Search
`SearchEngine` runs on a serial background queue: a case-insensitive subsequence match over each item's plain text, cached per item id (items without plain text never match). Each `search` or `cancel` bumps a generation counter, so a superseded search stops early and its results are never delivered; `completion` runs on the main queue with the matching `HistoryItem`s (not indices).

### Automatic updates
`Updater` wraps Sparkle's `SPUStandardUpdaterController`. It only starts, and `Controller` only adds the "Check for Updates..." menu item, when `Info.plist` has an `https` `SUFeedURL` and a non-empty `SUPublicEDKey`. Both ship empty, so updates are off until the appcast URL and signing key are supplied; the `XCTEST` build never starts it. The release steps are in the README ("Automatic updates").

### UI-test hooks (compiled into the app)
Launching with `--uitesting` makes `AppDelegate` call `UITesting.setupUITestEnvironment`, which swaps `Helper.accessControlHelper` and `Helper.keyPressHelper` for mocks that exchange state with the test process through named pasteboards (`Yippy.UITesting.*`), and blanks `UserDefaults`. Extra launch args: `--Settings.testData=<name>` loads canned settings (`Settings.testData`, e.g. `a`, `ignoredApps`), and `--test-dir=<name>` replaces the app-support directory with a copy of `TestData/<name>` (it deletes the existing one, and needs `SRCROOT`). `Constants/Accessibility.swift` identifiers are compiled into both the app and `YippyUITests`, so changing one means both sides see it.

## Tests
Unit tests mock every system dependency (`FileManagerMock`, `ArrayFileManagerMock`, `DataFileManagerMock`, loggers, `Alerter`) and inject them through the initializers of `HistoryFileManager` and `HistoryCache`; follow that style rather than touching the real file system. `YippyTests.swift` is just Xcode's placeholder.

Several tests wait on predicate `XCTestExpectation`s. Chaining two of them through an expectation handler always timed out on current XCTest, so await each step in turn.

New source and test files must be added to `Yippy.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`; PRs that each add files tend to conflict there.
